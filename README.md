# Collection of Python Projects and Exercises

Welcome to the collection of Python projects and exercises! This repository contains a series of Python projects and exercises that I created while learning the language in 2018. These projects aim to showcase fundamental concepts and practical applications of Python programming.

##Basics Folder

Inside the `basics` folder, you'll find exercises and projects covering the following topics:

### 1. Primitive Types

In the `Primitive Types` section, you'll find exercises and examples related to basic data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, and more. These exercises will help you understand how to work with different types of data in Python and how to perform basic operations on them.

### 2. Control Flow

The `Control Flow` section contains exercises and projects focusing on control flow statements in Python, including if statements, loops (for and while loops), and conditional expressions. By working through these exercises, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to control the flow of your Python programs based on different conditions.

### 3. Functions

In the `Functions` section, you'll find exercises and projects that explore the concept of functions in Python. This includes defining functions, passing arguments, returning values, and understanding scope. These exercises will help you grasp the fundamentals of writing modular and reusable code in Python.

## How to Use

To get started, simply navigate to the relevant folder (`Primitive Types`, `Control Flow`, or `Functions`) and explore the exercises and projects inside. Each folder contains Python files with code examples, as well as README files providing additional explanations and instructions.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different approaches, and expand upon the projects to further your understanding of Python programming.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional exercises that you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated and will help improve this collection for other learners.
